    chapterTitle: "BEH: Behavioral Health Services",
    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The BEH category applies to ambulatory organizations that provide behavioral health services including mental health evaluation and treatment, substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, or both. Standards address therapeutic settings, patient rights specific to behavioral health (including restraint and seclusion restrictions), individualized treatment planning, documentation requirements, continuity of care, and staff competencies. Telehealth delivery of behavioral health services is explicitly addressed with specific requirements for privacy, therapeutic environment, and documentation.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "Therapeutic settings are appropriate for the type and intensity of behavioral health services provided.",
      "Patient rights specific to behavioral health — including freedom from inappropriate restraint and seclusion — are communicated and protected.",
      "Each patient has an individualized treatment plan based on comprehensive assessment.",
      "Staff providing behavioral health services have documented qualifications and training appropriate to their scope of practice.",
      "Continuity of care is facilitated through care coordination and discharge planning.",
      "Telehealth behavioral health services meet specific requirements for therapeutic environment and informed consent.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Group therapy rooms lack adequate privacy to prevent auditory or visual disclosure to other patients.",
      "Treatment plans are generic rather than individualized — lacking measurable goals or specific intervention plans.",
      "Staff qualifications for behavioral health are not verified — scope of practice for licensed counselors vs. psychologists is unclear.",
      "Telehealth behavioral health visits lack documentation of the technology platform used and privacy protections in place.",

      title: "BEH.100 — Behavioral Health Settings and Therapeutic Environment",
      content:
        "Behavioral health services must be provided in settings appropriate for the type and intensity of services offered. Settings must ensure: adequate privacy during individual therapy sessions (visual and auditory privacy); appropriate group therapy spaces that maintain patient confidentiality from non-participants; safe physical environments that do not pose ligature or self-harm risks for at-risk populations; and access to emergency support appropriate to the behavioral health conditions treated. For telehealth delivery, the therapeutic environment requires that the platform is HIPAA-compliant, staff are in a private location, and patients are informed of and encouraged to secure their own privacy.",
      keyPoint:
        "Behavioral health settings must provide true privacy — not just visual privacy but auditory privacy. Group therapy rooms must not allow other patients to overhear individual disclosures.",

      title: "BEH.110 — Patient Rights in Behavioral Health",
      content:
        "Patients receiving behavioral health services retain all rights described in the PRR category plus additional rights specific to behavioral health: freedom from inappropriate use of restraint or seclusion; the right to participate in treatment planning; the right to refuse specific treatments (with documentation of informed refusal); the right to have an advocate present; and specific protections related to confidentiality under 42 CFR Part 2 for substance use disorder records. SUD records have more stringent confidentiality protections than standard HIPAA — they generally cannot be disclosed without explicit patient consent, even to other treating providers.",
      keyPoint:

      title: "BEH.120 — Assessment and Individualized Treatment Planning",
      content:
        "Each behavioral health patient must receive a comprehensive assessment appropriate to the presenting condition, which forms the basis for an individualized treatment plan. The treatment plan must include: presenting problems and diagnoses (using current DSM criteria); measurable treatment goals with target timelines; specific interventions planned; the disciplines/providers involved; a discharge or transition planning component; and documentation of the patient's involvement in treatment planning. Treatment plans must be reviewed and updated at defined intervals based on the patient's progress and changing needs.",
      keyPoint:
        "Treatment plans must be individualized, measurable, and updated based on progress. 'Routine counseling' is not a treatment plan — specific goals (e.g., 'patient will develop and practice two coping strategies for anxiety within 30 days') with specific interventions are required.",

      title: "BEH.130 — Staff Qualifications in Behavioral Health",
      content:
        "Staff providing behavioral health services must hold the qualifications required by their state for their scope of practice — licensure as appropriate (licensed professional counselor, licensed clinical social worker, psychologist, psychiatrist, certified alcohol and drug counselor, etc.). The organization must verify these credentials through primary source verification and ensure that staff practice within their licensed scope. Supervision requirements for associate-licensed or license-eligible staff must be documented, with the supervising licensed clinician's credentials on file. Clinical staff must receive training appropriate to the specific behavioral health conditions treated.",
      keyPoint:
        "Behavioral health licensure is state-specific and scope-specific. An LPC may not perform the same services as a licensed psychologist. Supervision arrangements for associate-licensed staff must be formally documented.",

        "Continuity of care is particularly important in behavioral health, where abrupt interruption of treatment can have serious consequences including relapse or mental health crisis. The organization must have processes for: referring patients to higher or lower levels of care as clinically indicated (using established criteria such as ASAM criteria for SUD); ensuring warm handoffs when patients transition between providers or levels of care; communicating clinical information to receiving providers; and following up with patients who disengage from treatment prematurely. Discharge planning begins at admission and is updated throughout treatment.",
      keyPoint:
        "Discharge planning begins at admission in behavioral health — not when discharge is imminent. ASAM criteria guide level-of-care transitions for SUD. Premature disengagement requires documented follow-up attempts.",
