    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The GOV category sets expectations for the governing body's role in ensuring high-quality health care and organizational integrity. The governing body is legally responsible for all operations — clinical and administrative — and must establish strategic direction, define the scope of services, approve contracts, ensure regulatory compliance, and review accreditation requirements at least annually. Specific selective standards address anesthesia, surgical services, energy-emitting devices, laboratory, imaging, dental, and research oversight.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "The governing body determines the mission, goals, and objectives and evaluates progress annually.",
      "Bylaws, policies, financial management, and legal compliance are established and maintained by the governing body.",
      "The scope of services is formally defined and includes treatments, patient populations, and hours of operation.",
      "All major contracts and arrangements affecting clinical care are approved by the governing body.",
      "Accreditation requirements are reviewed at least annually, with revisions made as needed.",
      "Authority, responsibility, and functions of officers and administrators are clearly defined in writing.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Governing body minutes do not reflect annual review of accreditation requirements including QI, IPC, and safety programs.",
      "Scope of services document lacks population description or hours of operation.",
      "Major contracts for external services are in place but lack governing body approval documentation.",
      "Anesthesia techniques used are not documented as approved by the governing body.",

        "The governing body is responsible for setting strategic direction (mission, goals, long-range plans) and ensuring they are pursued — GOV.160. Under GOV.170, the governing body bears full legal responsibility for organizational operations either directly or through professional delegation. This includes establishing organizational structure, adopting bylaws, implementing financial management, ensuring compliance with all applicable laws (ADA, HIPAA, fraud/abuse, NPDB reporting), and overseeing compliance with AAAHC Standards. Product sales to patients and telehealth services must also be reviewed and approved.",

If telehealth or telemedicine services are offered, they must be referenced, defined, and approved in the scope of services. The governing body must review the scope of services at least annually (GOV.240.60) and revise as needed.",

GOV.200.50 further requires that services provided under all major contracts are rendered in a safe and effective manner, meaning ongoing monitoring — not just initial approval — is expected.",

Revisions must be made as needed following each review.",
