    chapterTitle: "CPV: Credentialing and Privileging",
    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The CPV category establishes requirements for how an ASC verifies the qualifications of its medical and dental staff and grants them specific clinical privileges. The governing body is ultimately responsible for credentialing and privileging. Every practitioner must complete a formal application, provide evidence of training and current competence, and submit to primary or secondary source verification before privileges are granted. Reappointment occurs at least every three years with the same rigor. Ongoing monitoring of licensure, DEA registration, and board certification keeps credentials current between formal reviews.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "The governing body has defined, uniform criteria for initial appointment and reappointment of medical/dental staff.",
      "Each application for privileges includes verified evidence of training, experience, current competence, current license, NPDB query, and DEA registration (if applicable).",
      "Applicants provide written attestation on their application addressing liability history, licensure actions, adverse privilege history, federal sanctions, criminal history, and health status.",
      "Primary or secondary source verification is conducted for each application before privileges are granted.",
      "Reappointment occurs at least every three years, with peer review results incorporated into the decision.",
      "Date-sensitive information — licensure, DEA, board certification — is monitored on an ongoing basis.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Credentials were approved solely because a hospital granted the same privileges — no independent ASC verification.",
      "NPDB was queried at initial appointment but not at reappointment.",
      "Peer review results are maintained separately and not brought into the reappointment decision.",
      "Licensure and DEA expiration dates are not tracked between formal reappointment cycles.",
    ],

      content:
        "The medical and dental staff are accountable to the governing body through a credentialing, privileging, and reappointment process for which the governing body is ultimately responsible. CPV.100 requires that the governing body: (1) has defined specific criteria for initial appointment and reappointment, (2) applies those criteria uniformly to all applicants, (3) processes applications according to timeframes specified in bylaws or policies, and (4) maintains its own independent credentialing and privileging process. Privileges may not be approved solely because another organization — such as a hospital — has already approved them. That other organization's status may be considered, but it does not substitute for the ASC's own independent verification.",
      keyPoint:
        "The governing body is responsible for credentialing and privileging — not the administrator, medical director, or an outside organization. Hospital privileges do not automatically transfer. The ASC must have its own independent process.",

      title: "CPV.130 — Approved Processes for Credentialing, Privileging, and Reappointment",
      content:
        "CPV.130 requires the governing body to have formally approved written processes covering: (1) credentialing, (2) initial appointment, (3) reappointment, (4) granting of clinical privileges, (5) suspension or termination of clinical privileges, and (6) appeals of decisions to suspend or terminate privileges. All these processes must be consistent with applicable state law. These are not informal understandings — they must be documented in bylaws, policies, or procedures that the governing body has reviewed and approved.",
      keyPoint:
        "Every phase of the credentialing and privileging cycle must have a governing body-approved written process: initial credentialing, appointment, reappointment, granting privileges, suspending privileges, and the appeal process.",

        "A formal application for initial staff privileges must require the applicant to provide sufficient evidence of: training, experience, and current documented competence for the procedures requested; peer references documenting current competence; a current state license; NPDB information; DEA registration information (if applicable); and proof of current medical liability coverage meeting governing body requirements (if applicable). 'Current documented competence' is key — training completed years ago without evidence of ongoing practice is not sufficient. Peer references confirm that individuals who have observed the applicant's practice can attest to their current ability.",
      keyPoint:
        "The initial application must capture five categories: (1) training/experience/competence, (2) peer references for current competence, (3) current state license, (4) NPDB, (5) DEA (if applicable). All five must be addressed.",

The application must also include a formal liability release, an attestation to accuracy and completeness, and a dated signature. An incomplete or unsigned application may not be processed.",
      keyPoint:

      content:
        "Upon receipt of a completed and signed application, primary or secondary source verification of credentials must be conducted according to the organization's written procedures. 'Primary source verification' means confirming information directly with the source that issued the credential — for example, verifying licensure through the state licensing board's online portal, not by accepting a copy of the license from the applicant. Organizations may use a Credentials Verification Organization (CVO) that is accredited or certified by a nationally recognized accreditation body; if so, the CVO must perform primary source verification. The same items required on the initial application (license, training, competence, NPDB, DEA) are the items that must be verified through primary or secondary sources.",
      keyPoint:

The reappointment application must include at minimum: updated personal information, completed attestation questions (the same attestation categories as initial appointment — covering adverse actions, licensure changes, health status, etc.), and a dated signature. Upon receipt of the completed reappointment application, primary or secondary source verification must again be conducted — the same elements that were verified at initial appointment must be re-verified. Reappointment is not a rubber stamp — it is a full credentialing review of current status.",

        "The governing body makes final appointment and reappointment decisions following review of the applications or based on recommendations from an internal delegate (such as a Medical Director or Credentials Committee). If the governing body delegates initial review, documentation of the delegation must be present. Critically, peer references and/or peer review activities and results — completed in accordance with AAAHC quality standards — must be incorporated into the appointment and reappointment decision process. At initial appointment, peer references provide this function. At reappointment, the organization's own peer review data (case reviews, quality monitoring results) serve this role. All governing body appointment and reappointment decisions must be documented.",
      keyPoint:

This ongoing monitoring applies to: state licensure (which may expire before the three-year reappointment cycle), DEA registration (which has its own renewal cycle), and board certifications (which may require Maintenance of Certification activities or periodic renewal). If a licensure or DEA expiration passes without renewal and the practitioner continues to practice, both the practitioner and the organization are in violation. Organizations may use NPDB Continuous Query as an acceptable option for ongoing monitoring.",
