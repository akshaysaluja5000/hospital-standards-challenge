The prepped extremity is held elevated by a team member (the hand-holder) using proper technique, an impervious stockinette is applied to create a sterile barrier around the limb, and split sheets are used to create a circumferential sterile field. This allows the surgical team to manipulate the extremity during the procedure while maintaining sterility.

      baseExplanation: "The OR temperature should be within the 68-75 degrees F (20-24 degrees C) range per ASHRAE standards before the next case begins. Temperature may be adjusted for specific patient populations (e.g., pediatric or burn patients may require warmer settings). The room must be at the appropriate temperature before sterile supplies are opened and the patient enters, as temperature affects both sterility and patient normothermia.",

These parameters must be monitored, documented, and any out-of-range readings must trigger corrective action per Joint Commission standards.",

          question: "The surveyor observes the turnover process between cases and notes that the EVS staff used the same mop and bucket solution for three consecutive OR rooms. What is the concern per AORN and Joint Commission environmental cleaning standards?",
          options: [
          "This is acceptable practice as long as the cleaning solution was prepared at the correct dilution at the start of the shift",
          "The only concern is whether the mop head was wrung out properly between rooms",
          "Cleaning solutions become contaminated with organic material and microorganisms during use",

        ],
        correctIndex: 2,
          explanation: "Using the same mop and cleaning solution across multiple rooms creates a risk of cross-contamination. Cleaning solutions become progressively contaminated with organic soil, blood, and microorganisms, reducing their antimicrobial efficacy. Per AORN guidelines and infection prevention best practices, mop heads should be changed (or dedicated microfiber cloths used) and fresh cleaning solution prepared for each room. Many facilities have transitioned to microfiber mopping systems or disposable mop heads to address this. The surveyor should verify the facility's environmental cleaning protocol specifies single-room use of cleaning materials.",

          "Terminal cleaning requires use of a different EPA-registered disinfectant than between-case cleaning",
          "Terminal cleaning only adds floor scrubbing with a mechanical floor scrubber to the between-case protocol",

        correctIndex: 0,
          explanation: "AORN distinguishes between-case cleaning (focused on immediate procedural area, horizontal surfaces, and equipment used during the case) and terminal cleaning (comprehensive cleaning of the entire room). Terminal cleaning adds: cleaning all wall surfaces to a minimum height (typically door height or higher), moving all portable equipment to clean floor underneath, cleaning ceiling-mounted equipment tracks and surgical light fixtures, wet-vacuuming or damp-mopping the entire floor surface, and cleaning adjacent substerile areas and scrub sinks. Both processes use EPA-registered hospital-grade disinfectants at proper contact time, but terminal cleaning is significantly more extensive in scope.",

          explanation: "The neutral zone (also called hands-free technique or safe zone) is a designated area on the sterile field where sharp instruments are placed by one person and picked up by another, eliminating simultaneous hand-to-hand contact with sharp instruments. This AORN-recommended practice significantly reduces percutaneous injuries among surgical team members. The neutral zone should be established at the beginning of each procedure and consistently used throughout.",

          "The fill line is a manufacturer suggestion, not a regulatory requirement",

        ],
        correctIndex: 2,
          explanation: "OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogen Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) requires that sharps containers be replaced routinely and not be allowed to overfill. The manufacturer's fill line (typically 2/3 to 3/4 capacity) represents the maximum safe fill level. Overfilled containers increase the risk of needlestick injuries when staff attempt to force additional items in or when protruding sharps contact hands during handling. This is a frequently cited OSHA violation during Joint Commission surveys and can result in both JC findings and OSHA citations.",

          explanation: "The Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act (amending OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogen Standard) requires facilities to maintain: a detailed sharps injury log (type of device, department, circumstances — more detailed than the OSHA 300 log), documentation of annual evaluation of safer sharps devices with direct input from frontline healthcare workers who use the devices, evidence that safety-engineered sharps devices are implemented unless contraindicated (with documented clinical justification for exceptions), and an Exposure Control Plan updated at least annually. Joint Commission surveyors verify these elements and expect the facility to demonstrate an active sharps injury prevention program, not just documentation of past injuries.",
