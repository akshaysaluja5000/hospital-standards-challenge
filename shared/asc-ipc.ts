    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The IPC category requires ASCs to maintain a comprehensive, governing-body-approved infection prevention and control program based on nationally recognized guidelines. The program must integrate with quality improvement, comply with OSHA and applicable laws, and be led by a designated qualified professional. Key operational areas include hand hygiene surveillance, safe injection practices, instrument sterilization, sharps injury prevention, cross-infection safeguards, and environmental cleaning.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "A written IPC program is approved by the governing body and updated by annual risk assessment.",
      "The program is directed by a qualified health care professional with documented IPC training and competence.",
      "Active surveillance of hand hygiene and safe injection practices is required per CDC/WHO guidelines.",
      "Cleaning, decontamination, high-level disinfection, and sterilization follow nationally recognized guidelines and manufacturer instructions.",
      "A written sharps injury prevention program governs disposal, container placement and replacement, and regulated waste handling.",
      "The surgical environment has written policies for attire, aseptic technique, and environmental controls.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Active surveillance of hand hygiene or safe injection practices is absent or not documented.",
      "Biological indicators are missing from sterilization cycles — only external/internal indicators are used.",
      "Sharps containers are overfilled beyond the fill line, or placed in locations where they cannot be secured from tampering.",
      "Environmental controls (temperature, humidity, air pressure in ORs) are not monitored or documented against nationally recognized guidelines.",
    ],

        "Standard IPC.100 requires a written infection prevention and control program that is (1) approved by the governing body, (2) validated by an annual formal infection prevention risk assessment, (3) based on nationally recognized guidelines selected by the governing body, (4) integrated into the quality improvement program, and (5) compliant with all applicable state, federal, and OSHA requirements. For Medicare Deemed Status organizations, failure to follow nationally recognized infection control guidelines can result in a condition-level citation.",

Active surveillance means ongoing, documented observation — not just a policy statement. IPC.130.20 requires a written hand hygiene policy specifying appropriate products per manufacturer's instructions for use.",

Critically, IPC.170.30 requires that internal AND external indicators, including biological indicators, are used with items undergoing sterilization. Biological indicators (e.g., Geobacillus stearothermophilus spore strips) provide the highest level of sterilization assurance. All processes must adhere to nationally recognized guidelines, manufacturer's instructions, and state/federal requirements.",

Containers must not be overfilled — replacement at the fill line is a specific, enforceable requirement.",

Note: NA may be applied if only non-sterile procedures are conducted.",
      keyPoint:
