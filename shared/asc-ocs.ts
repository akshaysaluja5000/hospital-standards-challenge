      "The OCS category addresses specialty clinical services that may be provided in ambulatory settings. Standards apply to dental care, medical oncology/chemotherapy, reproductive health services, in vitro fertilization, women's health, and other specialty ambulatory care. Each specialty area has specific requirements for qualified personnel, safety protocols, patient selection, and quality monitoring. OCS standards supplement the core clinical standards (CMC, ASG, MED) with specialty-specific requirements.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "Dental services are provided by appropriately licensed dentists and dental staff with verified credentials.",
      "Chemotherapy administration follows established safety protocols for hazardous drug handling and administration.",
      "Reproductive health services maintain specific privacy and counseling standards.",
      "In vitro fertilization facilities meet specific laboratory and clinical standards.",
      "Specialty services are governed by a qualified physician director with appropriate specialty expertise.",
      "Patient selection criteria for each specialty service are defined and applied consistently.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Chemotherapy agents are prepared or handled without appropriate hazardous drug safety protocols (PPE, biological safety cabinet).",
      "Dental radiography is performed by staff without state-required radiology credentials.",
      "Specialty service governing physician does not have verified credentials in the specialty.",

      title: "OCS.100 — Dental Services",
      content:
        "When dental services are provided, they must be directed by a qualified dental director. All dentists and dental hygienists must hold current state licensure verified through primary source verification. Dental radiography must be performed by appropriately licensed/certified personnel. Dental records must include: dental/medical history, examination findings, dental charting, treatment plans, informed consent, and procedure notes. Infection prevention practices specific to dentistry (instrument sterilization, dental unit water line management) must be addressed in the IPC program.",
      keyPoint:
        "Dental services require a dental director, licensed dentists and hygienists, licensed dental radiographers, dental-specific clinical records, and dental infection prevention protocols — all verified and documented separately from general medical credentialing.",

Chemotherapy administration protocols must define: patient eligibility criteria, dose verification (independent double-check), pre-medication requirements, monitoring during infusion, and management of adverse reactions.",
      keyPoint:
        "Chemotherapy is a high-alert medication with unique hazardous drug handling requirements: BSC preparation, negative pressure room, PPE, spill kits, hazardous waste disposal — all must be documented. Dose verification requires an independent double-check process.",

Non-directive counseling must be available — patients must receive information about all options and make autonomous decisions without coercion. Informed consent must be comprehensive and include all relevant options, risks, and alternatives. Confidentiality protections are particularly important in reproductive health — minors' rights to confidential services vary by state and type of service. Staff must be educated on applicable legal requirements.",

The laboratory director must have specific qualifications in reproductive endocrinology or clinical embryology. Embryo mix-up prevention is the highest-priority patient safety concern in IVF.",

Specialty-specific quality metrics must be monitored — for example, chemotherapy: adverse reaction rates, dose calculation errors, extravasation events; for dental: post-procedure infection rates, retreatment rates; for IVF: clinical pregnancy rates, multiple gestation rates, cryopreservation success rates. Specialty-specific incidents must be reviewed through both the quality and peer review programs. Benchmarking against national or specialty-specific data is particularly important in specialty services where local volume may be insufficient for statistical analysis.",
