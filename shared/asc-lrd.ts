    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The LRD category applies when an ASC provides laboratory testing or imaging services, either directly or through contracted arrangements. Standards require a qualified laboratory director, CLIA compliance for laboratory services, documented quality control, and qualified personnel for all laboratory and imaging activities. Radiology services require licensed radiographers and qualified physicians for interpretation. Both laboratory and radiology services must maintain documentation of quality assurance activities.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "Laboratory services (including POCT) are performed under appropriate CLIA certification.",
      "A qualified laboratory director oversees all laboratory activities.",
      "Quality control procedures are conducted, documented, and reviewed for all laboratory tests.",
      "Imaging services are performed by qualified radiologic technologists.",
      "Radiologic studies are interpreted by qualified, privileged physicians.",
      "Diagnostic results are communicated to the ordering provider in a timely manner.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Point-of-care testing (blood glucose, urine dip) is performed without a CLIA certificate or falls outside the scope of an existing CLIA waiver.",
      "Quality control documentation for laboratory tests is missing or infrequent.",
      "Imaging studies are interpreted by providers without documented imaging interpretation privileges.",
      "Critical lab or radiology results are not communicated promptly to the ordering provider.",

      title: "LRD.130 / LRD.140 — CLIA Certificate and State Laboratory License",
      content:
        "LRD.130 requires that a current, appropriate CLIA certificate is present for the laboratory services performed: a CLIA Certificate of Waiver for waived tests (blood glucose, urine dipstick, rapid strep, etc.), a Certificate for Provider Performed Microscopy (PPMP) for those specific tests, or a Certificate of Registration, Compliance, or Accreditation for higher-complexity testing. LRD.140 additionally requires a current state medical laboratory license or certificate appropriate for the level of testing performed (where state licensure programs are separate from CLIA). Both certificates must be current — an expired CLIA waiver means the laboratory is operating outside its authorized complexity level. Note: if the state is exempt from CLIA program requirements, NA may apply.",
      keyPoint:
        "CLIA applies to ALL laboratory testing including point-of-care testing. The CLIA certificate type must match the complexity of tests performed. State lab licensure (LRD.140) is a separate requirement. Both must be current.",

Staff with laboratory responsibilities must be appropriately trained for their roles, as demonstrated by documented competency tests. Additionally, interviews and observation must confirm that a sufficient number of trained and experienced personnel are available to supervise and conduct the work of the laboratory. This applies to all testing personnel — including nurses and medical assistants who perform point-of-care testing. The competency documentation must be task-specific: a nurse documented as competent for blood glucose POCT needs separate competency documentation if they also perform urine dipstick testing.",
      keyPoint:
        "LRD.150 requires two things for laboratory personnel: (1) documented competency for each specific test performed, and (2) sufficient numbers of trained staff confirmed through observation and interviews. Competency is test-specific — not a blanket laboratory credential.",

LRD.170 is a separate, distinct requirement: laboratory test results must be reviewed and acknowledged in writing (manually or electronically) by the ordering provider or a qualified designee.
