    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The SAF category requires ASCs to implement a comprehensive safety program that prevents injury, manages hazards, protects patients and staff, and meets all applicable local, state, and federal safety requirements. Key components include a written risk management program with defined incident and adverse event definitions, a system for reviewing and acting on incidents, environmental hazard controls, product recall procedures, expiration date monitoring, hazardous waste management, bloodborne pathogen protections, occupational chemical exposure reduction, and fire prevention.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "A written risk management program includes policies addressing impaired providers, after-hours coverage, and patient dismissal.",
      "Incidents and adverse events are formally defined, and all are reviewed with corrective actions documented.",
      "Written safety program addresses medication error prevention, fall prevention, skin/tissue injury prevention, and food safety.",
      "A product recall policy identifies sources, staff notification, patient impact determination, and response procedures.",
      "All products with expiration dates are monitored and disposed of per policy and manufacturer guidelines.",
      "Bloodborne pathogen procedures include hepatitis B program, post-exposure protocols, and appropriate recordkeeping.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Incidents are logged but never analyzed to identify root causes or systemic improvements.",
      "Product recall policy exists but staff cannot describe how they are notified of recalled items.",
      "Expiration date monitoring is informal — no systematic tracking or documentation of monitoring activities.",
      "Fire safety training records do not cover all staff, or drills have not occurred within the past year.",

Additionally, policies must address: near-miss reporting encouragement, reportable event communication, periodic litigation review, patient complaint review with defined response times, notification to the liability carrier of adverse events, and periodic clinical record review.",

An incident includes any clinical or non-clinical occurrence not consistent with routine care, including near-miss events. An adverse event includes unexpected occurrences causing death or serious injury not related to the patient's natural disease course, process variations with risk of serious adverse outcome, breaches in medical/administrative care, and drug/material reactions. SAF.130 requires that all incidents and adverse events are reviewed, acted upon when appropriate, analyzed to identify underlying causes, and that improvements are implemented when indicated.",
