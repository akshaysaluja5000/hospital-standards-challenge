This is not optional and cannot be deferred to SPD. When organic material dries on instrument surfaces, it becomes exponentially harder to remove during decontamination, and standard cleaning processes may fail to reach it. The process involves: (1) wipe off visible debris, (2) spray all surfaces with enzymatic pre-cleaner solution, (3) ensure solution contacts all crevices, box locks, and lumens. Pre-cleaner solution must always be available in the soiled utility room and stocked near the OR. Enzymatic sprays break down proteins and prevent bioburden from adhering during transport.",
