    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The ASG category establishes requirements for the entire surgical episode — from pre-operative assessment through post-operative care. Standards cover patient identification, surgical site marking, the pre-procedural pause (time-out), anesthesia management, monitoring during procedures, management of anesthesia complications, recovery care, and discharge criteria. The ASG standards reflect a systems approach to preventing surgical and anesthesia adverse events.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "Pre-operative assessment is completed and documented before the procedure begins, including anesthesia evaluation.",
      "Patient identity, procedure, and surgical site are verified using at least two patient identifiers before the procedure.",
      "Surgical site is marked before the procedure with patient involvement when applicable.",
      "A formal pre-procedural time-out is conducted immediately before the incision/procedure begins.",
      "Anesthesia monitoring follows nationally recognized standards throughout the procedure.",
      "Post-anesthesia recovery includes documented monitoring, and discharge occurs only when defined criteria are met.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Time-out documentation is absent, or the time-out is conducted before all team members are present.",
      "Surgical site marking is done by a nurse rather than the operating practitioner.",
      "Post-anesthesia discharge criteria are not written, or patients are discharged without meeting documented criteria.",
      "Anesthesia monitoring documentation is incomplete for the procedure or recovery period.",

        "Before any surgical or procedural intervention, the patient must receive a complete pre-operative assessment that includes: medical history and physical examination (H&P), review of prior anesthesia records, assessment of the airway, review of current medications, and identification of any conditions that may affect anesthesia or the surgical outcome. The H&P must be completed within the organization's defined timeframe. Informed consent for both the procedure and anesthesia must be documented in the clinical record before the procedure begins.",

For procedures involving laterality (left vs. right), level (spinal), or a specific site among multiple possible sites, the surgical site must be marked — with patient or representative involvement when possible. The operating practitioner performing the procedure is responsible for the site marking. An exception exists for procedures where the marking would be clinically inappropriate (oral procedures, superficial/single-site procedures per organizational policy).",

Standard monitoring for anesthesia includes: pulse oximetry, end-tidal CO2 monitoring (for patients receiving general anesthesia or deep sedation), continuous ECG, blood pressure monitoring at defined intervals, and temperature monitoring when indicated. The anesthesia record must document the continuous monitoring data, medications administered (agent, dose, time), any complications, and the condition of the patient throughout the procedure.",
