    chapterTitle: "CRD: Clinical Records",
    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The CRD category establishes requirements for maintaining complete, accurate, and secure patient clinical records. A designated person must oversee the clinical records system, and written policies must govern how records are collected, stored, protected, and released. Every patient must have an individual record with consistent, legible entries that document the reason for the visit, findings, care provided, medications, and the treating provider's signature. Allergy and sensitivity information must be recorded prominently and verified at every encounter. Clinical records must support continuity of care and maintain strict confidentiality.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "A designated person is in charge of clinical records and the health information system.",
      "Written policies address record security, release, protection from damage or loss, unauthorized access, retention, and retirement.",
      "Clinical records are maintained in a consistent format that is legible, organized, and accessible to authorized personnel whenever the organization is open.",
      "An individual clinical record is established for each patient and includes name, ID number, date of birth, gender, and responsible party.",
      "Each visit entry documents the date, chief complaint, clinical findings, care rendered, medication changes, discharge diagnosis, and provider signature.",
      "Allergy and sensitivity information is recorded in a prominent, consistent location in every record and verified at each encounter.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Clinical records are not consistently organized — different practitioners use different formats making record navigation unreliable.",
      "Allergy documentation is missing from some records or recorded in varying locations rather than a prominent, consistent location.",
      "Patients are not asked about allergies and sensitivities at each encounter — only at initial registration.",
      "Provider authentication (signature or electronic equivalent) is absent from some visit entries.",

      title: "CRD.120 — Clinical Records System: Collection, Processing, and Maintenance",
      content:
        "CRD.120 requires the organization to maintain a system for the accurate collection, processing, maintenance, storage, retrieval, and distribution of clinical records. Two designated persons are required: one in charge of clinical records overall, and one in charge of the health information system. The system must include measures to ensure adherence to written policies and procedures, and it must be monitored on a regular basis. This standard establishes the infrastructure on which all other CRD standards depend — without a defined, monitored system, the organization cannot consistently satisfy record content and security requirements.",
      keyPoint:
        "CRD.120 requires two designated roles (clinical records oversight + health information system) and a monitored system with written procedures. The system must be actively overseen — not simply exist.",
    },
    {
      title: "CRD.130 — Written Policies for Clinical Records",
      content:
        "Written policies for clinical records must address seven specific areas: (1) security of information — including accountability for editing, deletion, and access of record content; (2) release of patient records — including patient authorization requirements; (3) protection of records from damage or loss — including backup systems for electronic records; (4) methods to deter unauthorized access; (5) ensuring timely access to individual records for authorized personnel; (6) retention of active records; and (7) retirement of inactive records. The retention policy must be consistent with applicable state and federal law. Backup systems for electronic records are explicitly required.",
      keyPoint:
        "CRD.130 requires seven specific policy topics. Electronic record backup systems are explicitly mentioned — organizations using EHRs must have a documented backup and recovery procedure as part of their written records policies.",

    {
      title: "CRD.140 — Records Maintained to Facilitate Safe Care",
      content:
        "Clinical records must be maintained in a manner that facilitates the provision of safe care. This means: (1) consistent content and format — organized in the same sequence across records except where law requires otherwise; (2) legibility — all entries must be legible, including items scanned into an electronic record; (3) accessibility — entries must be easily accessible within the record by authorized personnel; (4) availability — all clinical information relevant to a patient must be readily available to authorized personnel any time the organization is open to patients; and (5) patient control of release — patients must be given the opportunity to approve or refuse release of their records, except when release is permitted or required by law.",
      keyPoint:
        "CRD.140 has five elements: consistent format, legible entries, easy accessibility, availability during all operating hours, and patient authorization for release. A scanned document that is illegible violates CRD.140 just as a handwritten illegible entry does.",

      title: "CRD.160 — Strict Confidentiality of Clinical Records",
      content:
        "Any record containing clinical, social, financial, or other data about a patient must be treated as strictly confidential — except when release is required by law. Written policies must require strict confidentiality, and interviews and observation during survey must confirm that patient data is handled confidentially in practice. This standard applies across all forms of records — paper, electronic, verbal discussions, and any other medium in which patient data is communicated. If the organization provides telehealth or telemedicine services, compliance with the HITECH Act must be included in the confidentiality policies.",
      keyPoint:
        "Confidentiality covers all patient data — clinical, social, and financial — in all formats. The standard requires both written policies AND observed practice. A staff member discussing a patient case in a public area violates CRD.160 even if no written policies were violated.",

The record must include the patient's name, identification number (if used in the organization's system), date of birth, gender, and responsible party. CRD.190 requires that entries for each visit are consistent across records and include: (1) date and department (if departmentalized); (2) chief complaint or purpose of visit and history; (3) clinical findings and studies ordered (labs, imaging); (4) care rendered and therapies administered; (5) any changes in prescription or non-prescription medications with name, dosage, and frequency when available; (6) discharge diagnosis or impression and disposition, recommendations, and instructions given to the patient; and (7) signature or authentication by the healthcare professional.",

Four specific requirements apply: (1) patients are asked about allergies and sensitivities at each encounter — not just at registration; (2) patients reporting allergies or sensitivities must be asked to describe their specific reaction (rash, anaphylaxis, GI symptoms, etc.) — not just list the allergen; (3) allergy and sensitivity information is recorded in a prominent and consistently defined location — not buried in free-text notes; and (4) the information is verified at each encounter and updated when changes are reported.",
      keyPoint:
        "CRD.210 has four requirements: ask at EACH encounter (not just at intake), document the REACTION (not just the allergen), record in a PROMINENT/CONSISTENT location, and VERIFY and UPDATE at every encounter. Missing any one of these four is a deficiency.",

Evidence that each item was reviewed prior to incorporation must be present (e.g., a provider's initials or signature with date). CRD.230 requires that clinical records document discussions with the patient about the necessity, appropriateness, and risks of proposed care, surgery, or procedures, as well as discussions of treatment alternatives as applicable. The informed consent discussion must be documented — a signed consent form alone may not capture the substance of the discussion.",
      keyPoint:

Three specific elements are required: (1) documentation of missed and canceled appointments (if any occur) — allowing the organization to identify patients who may need follow-up; (2) documentation of medical advice given to a patient by text, email, or telephone — including after-hours medical advice, with the content of the advice documented, not just that a call occurred; and (3) for patients who have had three or more visits or admissions, or who have a complex and lengthy record, a summary of past and current diagnoses, problems, and past procedures must be present in the record to facilitate continuity. This summary may take the form of a problem list, a cumulative medication list, or a structured summary note.",
