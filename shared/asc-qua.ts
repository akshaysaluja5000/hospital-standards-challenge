      "The QUA category requires ASCs to maintain a multidimensional, multidisciplinary quality management and improvement program that integrates peer review, ongoing performance monitoring, infection prevention data, safety, and risk management. Peer review must be structured, ongoing, and include all privileged health care professionals. Quality improvement activities must use data to identify trends, drive action, and improve outcomes. Results must be reported to the governing body at least annually.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "Each physician, dentist, or health care professional is reviewed by at least one similarly privileged/licensed peer.",
      "Peer review criteria are developed and applied by privileged professionals — not just administrators.",
      "Clinical care is selected for ongoing review covering all similarly privileged professionals.",
      "QI data is collected continuously, evaluated for trends, and acted upon when problems are identified.",
      "Peer review results are reported to the governing body at least annually.",
      "QI studies include measurable goals, baselines, intervention, and re-measurement components.",

    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Peer review exists on paper but all privileged providers have not been reviewed in the past 12 months.",

For solo practitioners, an outside peer must provide the review (QUA.110). QUA.120 requires that privileged health care professionals actively participate in peer review: they help develop and apply review criteria for the care they provide, care is selected for ongoing review, the selection process covers all similarly privileged professionals, all clinical incidents are reviewed, and each provider is reviewed at least annually.",

The standard has three sequential elements: (1) data are collected in an ongoing manner; (2) data are periodically evaluated to identify trends or occurrences that affect patient outcomes; and (3) when data analysis identifies a problem and/or improvement opportunity, action is taken. The AAAHC guidance notes that benchmarking (comparing against external norms) is part of this process.",
