    overview: "DNV NIAHO is unique among hospital accreditation bodies in explicitly requiring an ISO 9001-based Quality Management System. This is not a bolt-on compliance exercise — it is the organizational backbone of how the hospital plans, monitors, improves, and accounts for quality. The governing body holds ultimate accountability; the CEO is responsible for implementation; and a designated Management Representative coordinates QMS activities and reports upward. Hospitals must have a written Quality Outline/Plan, conduct internal audits, perform management reviews at planned intervals, execute corrective and preventive action with verified effectiveness, and operate a Patient Safety System that captures both adverse events and near misses in a non-punitive environment.",

For hospitals, 'customer focus' translates directly to patient-centered care. The process approach means managing care delivery as interconnected processes rather than isolated departmental functions. Evidence-based decision making requires data — not assumption — to drive quality improvement.",
