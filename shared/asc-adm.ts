    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The ADM category sets expectations for how an ambulatory surgery center manages its administrative operations. This includes organizational structure, staffing adequacy, personnel records, orientation and training, performance evaluations, and policies and procedures. The governing body must ensure sufficient personnel are available, appropriately trained, and that the organization maintains documentation proving competency and compliance. Administrative systems must support safe, high-quality patient care.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "An organizational chart clearly defines reporting relationships and authority.",
      "Personnel are sufficient in number and qualifications for the services provided.",
      "All personnel have documented orientation, job-specific training, and annual competency verification.",
      "Personnel files contain licensure/certification verification, orientation records, performance evaluations, and health records.",
      "Written policies and procedures are current, accessible, and reviewed at defined intervals.",
      "Staff are oriented to and demonstrate knowledge of emergency procedures.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Personnel files lack documentation of current licensure — licenses lapsed without detection.",
      "Orientation records are incomplete for clinical staff hired within the past 12 months.",
      "Policies have not been reviewed or updated within the organization's stated review cycle.",
      "Staffing levels are not formally evaluated against patient volume and case complexity.",

      title: "ADM.100 — Organizational Structure and Administrative Authority",
      content:
        "The organization must have a defined administrative structure that clearly establishes reporting relationships and lines of authority. This typically takes the form of an organizational chart reviewed and approved by the governing body. The administrator (or equivalent) must have clearly delineated authority and responsibility for day-to-day operations, distinct from the governing body's oversight role. When authority is delegated, the delegation must be documented.",
      keyPoint:
        "Organizational structure must be documented — who reports to whom, and who has authority over what. Verbal arrangements are not sufficient for survey.",
    },

      title: "ADM.110 — Personnel Sufficiency",
      content:
        "The organization must have sufficient personnel — in number and qualifications — to provide the services offered safely and competently. This includes clinical staff (nurses, technicians, anesthesia providers), administrative staff, and any other personnel required by the organization's scope of services. Staffing assessments must account for patient volume, case complexity, and any regulatory requirements for staff-to-patient ratios. On-call coverage arrangements must also be documented.",
      keyPoint:
        "Staffing adequacy is not just about headcount — it is about having the right qualifications for the right services. Document your staffing assessment and how it is updated as services change.",

      title: "ADM.120 — Personnel Records and Credentialing Documentation",

        "Personnel files must contain documentation of: current licensure and/or certification (with expiration date tracking), orientation and initial training, ongoing competency assessments, annual performance evaluations, and relevant health screening records. For licensed professionals, primary source verification of licensure is expected. Records for credentialed practitioners overlap with CRD standards, but ADM.120 focuses on the employment record documentation for all personnel.",
      keyPoint:
        "Every personnel file should be a self-contained evidence package for that employee: license, orientation, competency, evaluation, health screening. Missing any element creates a survey finding.",

      title: "ADM.130 — Orientation and Training",
      content:
        "All personnel must receive orientation to the organization, their specific job duties, and applicable policies and procedures before providing services independently. Orientation must include emergency procedures, infection prevention practices, patient rights, and safety protocols. Ongoing training must be provided when new equipment, procedures, or policies are introduced. Training records must document content, date, trainer, and employee acknowledgment.",
      keyPoint:
        "Orientation is not a paperwork exercise — employees must demonstrate understanding of emergency procedures, IPC practices, and patient rights. Documentation must prove the training happened.",

All policies must be approved by the appropriate authority (governing body or designee) before implementation.",
