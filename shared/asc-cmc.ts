      "The CMC category establishes standards for the clinical care process at ambulatory surgery centers — from patient assessment through discharge and follow-up. Standards address clinical record content and management, diagnostic testing, care planning, discharge instructions, and coordination of care. The clinical record must be accurate, timely, complete, and serve as the primary communication tool among all members of the care team.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "Each patient has a clinical record that contains all required elements including H&P, consents, anesthesia record, operative note, and discharge documentation.",
      "Clinical records are completed in a timely manner per organizational policy.",
      "Discharge instructions are provided in writing and appropriate to the patient's condition and procedure.",
      "Follow-up care is arranged before or at the time of discharge.",
      "Care is coordinated among all providers involved in the patient's care.",
      "Diagnostic testing is ordered, performed, and results reviewed prior to planned procedures when clinically indicated.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Operative notes are dictated but not signed or finalized — an unsigned note is not a complete record.",

Required elements include: patient identification; relevant medical history; physical examination findings; diagnostic test orders and results; diagnoses; evidence of informed consent; anesthesia record (where applicable); operative or procedure note; medication orders and administration records; nursing assessments and notes; discharge instructions; and documentation of follow-up arrangements. Records must be legible, complete, accurate, and authenticated (signed) by the responsible health care professional.",

Abnormal results must be addressed — either resolved, evaluated for clinical significance, or the procedure decision must reflect the known abnormality. Routine pre-operative testing without clinical indication is not required by AAAHC standards and may not be appropriate. The clinical record must document the ordering provider's review of test results relevant to the planned procedure.",

Care planning in the ambulatory surgery context includes: the plan for the procedure (technique, anesthesia type), anticipated post-operative management, patient education plan, and discharge planning. In settings where ongoing care is required (e.g., wound management, medication changes post-procedure), documented care goals and instructions must be communicated to the patient and any other providers involved in follow-up care.",

Instructions must be appropriate to the patient's procedure and condition and must address: activity restrictions, diet instructions, wound care (if applicable), medications prescribed (with instructions for use), signs and symptoms requiring immediate medical attention, and follow-up appointment information. Instructions must be in a language and literacy level the patient can understand (PRR.440). Instructions must be documented in the clinical record.",

This includes: communication of relevant clinical findings to the referring or primary care provider; documentation of referrals sent and received; follow-up arrangements confirmed before the patient leaves; and — when the patient requires transfer to a higher level of care — documentation of the clinical status, receiving facility, and communication with the accepting provider. Coordination of care is particularly important for patients with complex comorbidities or when post-operative complications occur.",
