          explanation: "Joint Commission expects that alternative processes for patients who refuse marking provide verification that is at least equivalent in reliability to standard site marking. A policy that simply relies on verbal confirmation during the standard time-out does not add any safety barrier beyond what already exists — it effectively waives the marking requirement without substituting an alternative. The policy must include documentation of the refusal, specific alternative verification methods, communication to the entire team, and evidence that the alternative process has been validated to prevent wrong-site events.",

          explanation: "A wrong-patient imaging study reaching the OR represents a significant system failure in patient identification and verification.

          question: "The root cause analysis of the wrong-patient CT scan reveals that the radiology tech retrieved the study by searching the patient's last name only, and two patients with the same last name had CT scans on the same day.

The fix must address the systemic vulnerability: the PACS system allowing single-identifier retrieval. Implementing mandatory two-identifier matching in the retrieval workflow creates a hard stop that prevents this failure mode.

          question: "Six months after implementing the PACS two-identifier retrieval requirement, a JC surveyor returns for a follow-up survey. The facility shows data that wrong-patient imaging retrieval events dropped from 4 per quarter to zero. However, the surveyor discovers that OR staff have developed a workaround: when the PACS two-identifier search is slow, they photograph the imaging screen with a personal phone and use that image for surgical planning. What compliance issues does this workaround create?",

          "Compliance issue — staff are being resourceful to maintain workflow efficiency",

          explanation: "This scenario illustrates how safety system implementations can create unintended workarounds that introduce new risks — a concept known as 'risk migration.' The workaround bypasses the very safety barrier implemented to prevent wrong-patient imaging events, violates HIPAA through PHI on personal devices, may provide diagnostically inadequate images, and signals that the safety fix created an operational barrier staff felt compelled to circumvent. Joint Commission expects organizations to monitor for workarounds after implementing safety changes (PI.01.01.01), address them through process improvement (such as improving PACS speed or providing facility-owned devices), and maintain the integrity of safety barriers.",
