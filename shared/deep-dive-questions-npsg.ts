      baseQuestion: "A wrong-patient medication event is analyzed. The root cause: two patients with similar last names were in adjacent rooms. The nurse scanned the correct medication barcode but never scanned the patient's wristband. The barcode medication administration system allowed administration without the patient scan because the patient scan step had been disabled by IT to 'reduce alert fatigue.' What systemic failure does this reveal?",
      baseOptions: [
        "Individual nurse failure — the scan sequence is a nursing responsibility and the nurse should have followed the correct order regardless of system configuration",
        "A systemic failure in which a patient safety technology (barcode MAR) was deliberately configured to bypass a required safety step, eliminating a primary defense against wrong-patient errors",
        "An IT configuration error that is secondary to the primary cause — the nurse's failure to manually verify patient identity",
        "No systemic failure — wrong-patient events occur even with functioning barcode systems and the event was statistically expected"
      ],
      baseCorrectIndex: 1,
      baseExplanation: "Disabling the patient scan step in a barcode medication administration system eliminates the primary technology-based patient identification safeguard. This is a systemic failure — a safety technology was deliberately modified to reduce alerts in a way that created a direct patient harm pathway. The individual nurse's action occurred within a system that had removed a protective barrier.",

Leadership wants to re-enable the step system-wide but nursing directors warn it will increase alert burden by approximately 400 additional alerts per shift per unit. How should leadership balance the competing concerns?",
          options: [
            "Restore the patient scan requirement across all facilities — alert burden must be managed through education and compliance enforcement, not through disabling safety features",
            "The immediate action is to restore the patient scan requirement system-wide and simultaneously form an interprofessional team to address the root cause of alert fatigue through alert optimization — reducing non-actionable alerts, improving wristband readability, and streamlining the scan workflow rather than disabling the safety step",
            "Allow each hospital to decide independently based on their error rate and nursing preference",

          explanation: "Restoring the safety requirement is non-negotiable — the scan step is a primary defense against wrong-patient medication errors and cannot remain disabled. However, the alert fatigue concern is real and valid. The solution is to fix the underlying cause of the alert burden: wristband readability, scanner calibration, workflow design, and alert optimization. The two actions must happen simultaneously — restore the safety step immediately, and in parallel fix what was causing the burden that led to the unsafe configuration change.",

The team proposes training emergency nurses on reconciliation. What else does this data suggest about the reconciliation system?",

The receiving nurse asks about a critical lab result from 3 hours ago — the outgoing nurse was unaware of it. What does this scenario reveal about the handoff process?",

          question: "Investigation of missed doses reveals three contributing causes: (1) medication not available in ADC when due; (2) patients refusing injections; (3) nurses not administering due to incorrect hold parameters. Which of these causes requires a different type of intervention and what is it?",
          options: [
            "All three require the same intervention — nursing education on VTE prophylaxis importance",
            "Each cause requires a different intervention: (1) ADC availability requires a pharmacy stocking solution; (2) patient refusal requires structured patient education about VTE risk and prophylaxis benefits — including a standardized response protocol for nurses when patients refuse; (3) incorrect hold parameters require clinical decision support that clearly defines when prophylaxis should and should not be held, with a nurse-pharmacist consultation pathway for borderline cases. Treating all three with education alone will fix the third cause but not the first two",
            "Causes 1 and 3 are system problems; cause 2 is a patient autonomy issue that cannot be addressed through system interventions",

Patient behavior (cause 2) requires patient-focused education and communication. Clinical decision uncertainty (cause 3) requires clinical decision support tools. When a quality team applies a single intervention (nursing education) to multiple root causes, the intervention will only address the cause that education is designed to fix.",

      baseQuestion: "A nurse performs a structured handoff at shift change using the facility's approved SBAR format. The outgoing nurse tells the incoming nurse: 'Mr. Chen in 412 is stable — he's on warfarin for AFib, his INR was 2.6 this morning, and he's due for his 8 PM dose. No concerns.' The incoming nurse later discovers that Mr. Chen's morning INR result actually showed a critical value of 4.9, which was corrected in the chart 2 hours after initial entry due to a specimen labeling issue. The 2.6 was the original erroneous value. What handoff process failure occurred?",
      baseOptions: [
        "The handoff was adequate — the outgoing nurse communicated what they believed to be accurate based on available information",
        "Critical result updates and corrections must be incorporated into the active patient management and communicated at handoff — if the correct INR of 4.9 was in the chart 2 hours before shift change, the outgoing nurse failed to verify current information before handoff. Handing off based on a superseded value with a critical medication dose due represents a significant patient safety risk",
        "The failure is the laboratory's — the specimen labeling error that required correction should have been flagged to the nursing team directly",
        "The failure is an EHR design problem — result correction workflows should alert the current nursing user when a value they have viewed is superseded"
      ],
      baseCorrectIndex: 1,
      baseExplanation: "A handoff based on outdated or superseded critical values creates patient harm risk — in this case, the patient may receive a warfarin dose despite a supratherapeutic INR of 4.9. Pre-handoff preparation must include a current chart review that verifies the most recent values, not those reviewed hours earlier. Result corrections in the EHR — especially for critical values — must trigger active notification to the current care team, not just passive chart updates.",

          question: "To prevent similar events, the quality team proposes two interventions: (1) a requirement that nurses review all active medication orders and current labs within 30 minutes of shift start, and (2) an EHR alert that notifies the current nurse when a result they have previously viewed is corrected or superseded. Which intervention is more effective and why?",
          options: [
            "Intervention 1 is more effective — active nurse review is more reliable than EHR alerts, which are subject to alert fatigue",
            "Intervention 2 is more effective in isolation — a real-time system notification that pushes superseded-result alerts to the current nurse requires no behavior change and acts at the precise moment a critical update is made",
            "Both interventions are needed — intervention 2 provides immediate point-of-correction notification that intervention 1 cannot guarantee (the nurse may review labs before the correction occurs); intervention 1 provides a safety net for other information changes that would not trigger a correction alert. Together they provide redundant coverage across different failure modes",
            "Neither intervention is effective — handoff failures require cultural change, not process or technology interventions"
          ],
          correctIndex: 2,
          explanation: "Complementary interventions covering different failure modes are more effective than any single intervention. Real-time result correction alerts (intervention 2) catch the specific scenario where a value changes after the nurse has already reviewed it — which is precisely what occurred in this event. Structured post-handoff review (intervention 1) catches any changes that occurred before the nurse took report. Together they provide overlapping protection. Choosing only one leaves a gap that the other would have covered.",

      baseQuestion: "A hospital tracks its hand hygiene compliance rate using electronic dispenser sensors that record dispenser activation counts and estimate compliance based on room entry events. The reported rate is 88%. However, a concurrent direct observation audit shows 61% compliance. What does this discrepancy reveal?",
      baseOptions: [
        "The direct observation method is less reliable — observers may cause Hawthorne effect that artificially lowers observed rates",
        "The sensor-based methodology overcounts compliance — dispenser activations that do not correspond to patient contact moments (cleaning, non-clinical use), room entries not associated with patient care, and the inability to track whether gel was applied to both hands for adequate duration all mean sensor data systematically overestimates actual hand hygiene compliance",
        "The discrepancy is within statistical tolerance — an 88% reported versus 61% observed rate is expected variance given different measurement methodologies",
        "The direct observation data indicates observer bias — the 27-point gap suggests observers are scoring hand hygiene more conservatively than the standard requires"
      ],
      baseCorrectIndex: 1,
      baseExplanation: "Electronic dispenser sensor systems measure dispenser activations, not hand hygiene compliance. Multiple sources of overestimation exist: non-clinical dispenser uses, room entries not associated with patient contact, inadequate gel volume, and incomplete hand coverage. A 27-point gap between sensor-reported and observer-reported rates is consistent with known limitations of dispenser-based monitoring. Direct observation, while more labor-intensive, remains the more accurate compliance measurement method.",

            "Use the 88% rate — it is based on objective electronic data and requires no subjective observer interpretation",
            "Report the measurement methodology and both data points — transparency about measurement approach allows JC to evaluate the program's actual performance. Using only the sensor-reported rate without acknowledging the direct observation data misrepresents program performance and potentially masks a patient safety gap.

          correctIndex: 1,
          explanation: "Reporting only the more favorable metric from a known methodology with significant limitations — while a less favorable but more accurate measurement is available — is not transparent quality reporting. JC expects honest self-assessment. The resolution is to report both methodologies, acknowledge the discrepancy, explain its sources, and commit to a measurement improvement plan. The direct observation data at 61% is the more actionable figure for improvement planning.",
