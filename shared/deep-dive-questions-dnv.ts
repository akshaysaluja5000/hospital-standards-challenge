The education coordinator shows annual competency checklists with supervisor sign-off for all staff. However, for three nurses who transitioned from med-surg to ICU within the past year, no additional competency validation is documented beyond the standard annual checklist. What NIAHO PE finding exists?",

          "No finding — annual competency checklists apply equally to all nurses regardless of unit transfer",

A med-surg nurse transitioning to ICU must demonstrate ICU-specific competencies — hemodynamic monitoring, vasoactive drips, ventilator management — that are not covered by a general annual checklist.

              "Verbal competency confirmation by a charge nurse satisfies NIAHO PE if the charge nurse is available to attest to this during the survey",

            correctIndex: 1,
            explanation: "NIAHO PE standards require documented competency assessment. Orientation attendance proves exposure, not competency. A charge nurse's undocumented verbal attestation cannot be verified during a survey or referenced in future performance reviews.

            options: [
              "Yes — a written test with a defined passing score and retake process fully satisfies NIAHO PE competency requirements",
