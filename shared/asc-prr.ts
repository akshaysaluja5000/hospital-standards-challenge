    chapterTitle: "PRR: Patient Rights, Responsibilities and Protections",
    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The PRR category establishes expectations for recognizing every patient's legal and ethical entitlements throughout their episode of care. Patients must be treated with respect and dignity, informed of their rights and responsibilities before care begins, given access to organizational information, and provided a meaningful grievance pathway. Informed consent must be documented in the clinical record. Communication must occur in a language and manner the patient and caregiver can understand.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "Patients are treated with respect for personal, cultural, and religious beliefs at all times.",
      "Rights and grievance pathways are communicated to both patients and staff before care is rendered.",
      "Patients are informed of their responsibilities — accurate health history, treatment plan adherence, respectful behavior.",
      "Organizational information (services, credentials, fees, after-hours) is accessible without the patient having to request it.",
      "Informed consent for procedures and anesthesia is documented in the clinical record before care begins.",
      "Interpretive services, visual/hearing aids, and plain-language materials are available to support communication.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Rights notice is given after the patient is already gowned — too late to be meaningful.",
      "Grievances are resolved verbally with no written documentation of steps, results, or contact person.",
      "Consent form is signed but no evidence exists that the discussion of necessity and alternatives occurred.",
      "Staff cannot describe how patients with limited English access interpretive services.",

      title: "PRR.100 — Dignity, Privacy, and Shared Decision-Making",
      content:
        "AAAHC Standard PRR.100 requires that patients be treated in a manner respectful of personal, cultural, and religious beliefs; that patients have the right to personal privacy at check-in and in evaluation and treatment areas; and that patients are given the opportunity to participate in decisions involving their health care unless participation is contraindicated for medical reasons. In telehealth settings, staff must ensure visual, auditory, and electronic privacy on the clinical side, and should encourage patients to secure privacy on their end as well.",
      keyPoint:
        "Respect for beliefs, privacy at check-in and in care areas, and shared decision-making are the three non-negotiable pillars of PRR.100.",

      title: "PRR.180 / PRR.190 — Communicating Rights and Responsibilities Before Care",
      content:
        "Before care begins, both patients and staff must be informed of patient rights — including how to voice grievances, how to provide feedback, the right to change providers if alternatives are available, and advance directive rights as required by law. Separately, patients must be informed of their responsibilities: providing complete and accurate health information (including OTC products, supplements, and allergies), following the agreed-upon treatment plan, arranging a responsible adult for transportation, accepting financial responsibility for uncovered charges, and behaving respectfully toward health care professionals and others.",
      keyPoint:
        "PRR.180 = rights before care; PRR.190 = responsibilities before care. Both must be communicated to patients AND staff.",

      title: "PRR.200 — Organizational Information Accessible to Patients",
      content:
        "Standard PRR.200 requires that information about the organization is available to patients without them having to ask: the services provided, provisions for after-hours and emergency care, fees for services, payment policies, the credentials of health care professionals, and — if applicable — the absence of malpractice coverage. For telehealth organizations, an accurate fee schedule should be accessible and after-hours emergency access information should include how to reach clinicians remotely.",
      keyPoint:
        "Patients should not need to chase down basic organizational information. PRR.200 is an availability standard — not a 'on request' standard.",
    },

      title: "PRR.250 — Informed Consent for Procedures",
      content:
        "PRR.250 requires that before a surgical or procedural intervention, the clinical record demonstrates that the necessity or appropriateness of the proposed procedure and the available alternative treatment techniques were discussed with the patient. The patient's written consent (or that of their representative) must appear in the clinical record before the procedure is performed. A separate standard, PRR.240, requires documented consent for anesthesia. One consent form may satisfy both standards.",
      keyPoint:
        "Two elements must be documented: (1) the discussion of necessity, appropriateness, and alternatives; and (2) the written consent before the procedure — not after.",

      title: "PRR.440 — Communication in a Language and Manner the Patient Understands",
      content:
        "Standard PRR.440 requires that providers and staff communicate in a manner that the individual and/or the caregiver understands. This means interpretive services must be available for language differences, services must be available for patients with hearing or visual impairments, and information must be provided in a plain and easy-to-understand manner. Organizations should assume patients and caregivers may have difficulty comprehending health information and communicate proactively at an appropriate literacy level.",
      keyPoint:
        "Communication accessibility is a requirement, not a courtesy — interpretive services, impairment accommodations, and plain language are all independently required by PRR.440.",
