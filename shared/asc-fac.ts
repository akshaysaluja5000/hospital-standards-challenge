    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The FAC category addresses the physical environment and equipment of the ambulatory surgery center. Standards cover the safety of the physical environment, adequate space and equipment for the services provided, decontamination and instrument processing areas, environmental controls in procedure areas, equipment maintenance and calibration, alternate power for operative and recovery areas, and specialty equipment for specific service lines. The physical environment must support safe, effective patient care for all procedures performed.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "The physical environment is safe for patients, staff, and visitors.",
      "Space, equipment, and supplies are adequate for the procedures and services provided.",
      "The decontamination area is separate from clean and sterile areas, with unidirectional workflow.",
      "Environmental controls (temperature, humidity, ventilation) are maintained per nationally recognized guidelines.",
      "Medical equipment is maintained with documented periodic calibration and preventive maintenance per manufacturer specifications.",
      "Alternate power is available in operative and recovery areas for facilities using moderate/deep sedation or general anesthesia.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Decontamination area shares space with clean or sterile areas — no physical separation.",
      "Equipment maintenance logs are absent or show gaps between preventive maintenance dates.",
      "Emergency power backup is untested or documented only at initial installation without subsequent testing.",
      "Environmental control parameters (OR temperature/humidity) are not monitored or documented.",
    ],

      title: "FAC.100 — Safe Physical Environment",
      content:
        "FAC.100 requires that the physical environment of the organization is safe for patients, staff, and visitors. This is a Universal/Tier 1 standard, meaning its failure carries the highest weight. Safety of the physical environment encompasses: compliance with applicable life safety codes (fire safety, egress), elimination or control of identified hazards, compliance with building codes and standards applicable to healthcare facilities, and maintenance of facilities in a clean and organized manner that supports safe patient care.",
      keyPoint:
        "FAC.100 is the overarching safety standard for the physical plant. It intersects with SAF, IPC, and life safety code standards — surveyors assess the environment throughout the entire facility.",

      title: "FAC.200 / FAC.210 — Space, Equipment, and Instrument Processing",
      content:
        "FAC.200 requires that space, equipment, and supplies are adequate for the types and volumes of procedures performed. FAC.210 addresses the decontamination and instrument processing area specifically: a separate room or area must be designated for decontamination, with unidirectional workflow from soiled to clean to sterile. This physical separation prevents cross-contamination between soiled instruments and clean/sterile supplies. The decontamination area must have adequate sinks, personal protective equipment, and ventilation.",
      keyPoint:
        "FAC.210 is the physical separation standard for instrument processing: soiled instruments must travel in one direction only — from the decontamination zone to the cleaning zone to the sterile storage zone. Bidirectional traffic is a deficiency.",
    },
    {
      title: "FAC.220 / FAC.230 — Environmental Controls in Procedure Areas",
      content:
        "FAC.220 requires written policies addressing environmental controls for procedure areas, including temperature, humidity, and ventilation parameters that meet nationally recognized guidelines (e.g., ASHRAE 170). FAC.230 requires that environmental controls are actually implemented and documented. Procedure rooms that do not meet temperature, humidity, or air exchange requirements for the procedures being performed present infection and patient safety risks. Documentation of monitoring activities is required.",
      keyPoint:
        "Environmental controls must be (1) documented in written policy, (2) based on nationally recognized guidelines, and (3) actively monitored with results documented. All three elements must be present.",

    {
      title: "FAC.250 — Medical Equipment Maintenance",
      content:
        "FAC.250 requires that medical equipment is appropriately maintained through: written policies and procedures for equipment maintenance; standardized use of the equipment; requirements for periodic calibration per manufacturer's specifications (with documentation); and requirements for periodic testing and preventive maintenance per manufacturer specifications (with documentation). Equipment that requires calibration must have documented calibration records; equipment requiring preventive maintenance must have documented maintenance logs.",
      keyPoint:
        "FAC.250 has two documentation requirements: (1) calibration documentation (if equipment requires calibration), and (2) preventive maintenance documentation — both must be present and current.",

      title: "FAC.260 — Alternate Power for Operative and Recovery Areas",
      content:
        "FAC.260 is a selective standard requiring alternate power (backup power — generator or battery) to be available in operative and recovery areas, adequate for the types of surgery and procedures performed. This standard applies to organizations that administer moderate sedation/analgesia, regional anesthesia, deep sedation/analgesia, or general anesthesia. The alternate power must be tested to confirm adequacy and the test results must be documented.",
      keyPoint:
        "Alternate power must be (1) present, (2) adequate for the procedures performed, and (3) tested. An untested generator or a generator with insufficient capacity for OR equipment fails FAC.260.",
