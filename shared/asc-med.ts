    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The MED category applies to all ASCs that use drugs, biologicals, pharmaceutical supplies, or samples — regardless of whether an on-site pharmacy is present. The standards address oversight of pharmaceutical services, staff knowledge of prevailing laws, high-alert and look-alike/sound-alike (LASA) medication management, drug security and diversion prevention, medication storage and labeling, patient medication education, device maintenance for medication delivery, vaccine storage protocols, and disposal of expired or recalled medications.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "A written policy defines safe medication handling and administration per nationally recognized guidelines.",
      "DEA certification for controlled substances is current and readily retrievable.",
      "High-alert medication list is maintained and error-prevention processes are in place, including antidote co-storage.",
      "LASA medication list is maintained with processes to prevent administration errors.",
      "Pre-signed and post-dated prescriptions are prohibited by written policy.",
      "Medications removed from original containers are labeled with drug name, strength, amount/volume, expiration date/time, and preparer's name/initials.",
    ],
    commonRiskPoints: [
      "High-alert medication list exists but antidotes/reversal agents are not co-stored with the medications.",
      "Medications are labeled with drug name only — strength, expiration, and preparer's identity are missing.",
      "Multi-dose vials are used for multiple patients without documented policy or single-patient assignment.",
      "Vaccine temperature monitoring logs are absent or incomplete — temperature excursion response training is not documented.",
    ],
    aaahcStandards: ["MED.100", "MED.140", "MED.150", "MED.160", "MED.170", "MED.180", "MED.190", "MED.200", "MED.220", "MED.230", "MED.240"],

      title: "MED.100 — Pharmaceutical Services Oversight",
      content:
        "MED.100 requires pharmaceutical services to be provided in accordance with standards of care and prevailing laws. Specific requirements include: a written policy defining safe handling and administration per nationally recognized guidelines; posting of current pharmacy state license if required; maintenance of current DEA certification onsite (when controlled substances are present); staff demonstration of knowledge of prevailing pharmaceutical laws; and direct access to current drug information and decision support resources for all relevant staff. If services are provided by telehealth or telemedicine, the standard still applies.",

        "MED.140 requires monitoring the medication inventory to track high-alert medications and medications with confused drug names (LASA), with a written policy, documented staff training, and documented monitoring activities. MED.150 requires maintaining a list of currently stocked high-alert medications, implementing error-prevention processes per nationally recognized guidelines, and — critically — co-stocking antidotes, rescue agents, or reversal agents in the same area as the high-alert medication. MED.160 requires a LASA list and processes to prevent LASA administration errors.",
      keyPoint:
        "High-alert: list it, prevent errors, and co-stock the antidote. LASA: list it and prevent mix-ups. Both require documented monitoring. MED.150.30 on antidote co-stocking is a frequent survey finding.",

      title: "MED.170 / MED.180 — Drug Security and Storage",
      content:
        "MED.170 addresses drug security and diversion prevention: pre-signed and post-dated prescriptions are prohibited by written policy (MED.170.10); if prescription pads are used, they must be controlled and secured from unauthorized access; if electronic prescribing is used, systems must be controlled and secured. MED.180 requires drug storage (including samples) to maintain medication safety: medications must be segregated into organized, labeled storage areas designed to minimize drug selection errors; and medications must be stored per manufacturer requirements, state guidelines, and CDC guidelines.",
      keyPoint:
        "Pre-signed and post-dated prescriptions are a hard prohibition — not just a strong recommendation. Drug storage segregation into labeled areas and temperature/condition compliance are the key MED.180 elements.",

MED.200 requires labels to include at minimum: drug name(s), drug strength(s), amount(s) or volume(s) if not apparent from the container, expiration date and time, and the name or initials of the person transferring the drug. 'Immediate administration' means the person who prepares the medication administers it completely without any break in the process — if there is any gap, labeling is required.",
      keyPoint:
        "Five required label elements: name, strength, amount/volume (if not obvious), expiration date/time, and preparer's name or initials. Any gap between preparation and administration triggers the labeling requirement.",

Written policies must address routine storage and handling, AND emergency storage/handling (equipment failure, power outage, disaster). Staff who receive, handle, or administer vaccines must be trained on these policies. The vaccine storage unit must be equipped with a temperature monitoring device per adopted guidelines. Staff must demonstrate knowledge of procedures when vaccines are exposed to temperature excursions.",
      keyPoint:
