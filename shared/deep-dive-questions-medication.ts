      baseOptions: [
        "No concern — the concentration is printed on each bag label and nurses verify before hanging",

      baseCorrectIndex: 1,
      baseExplanation: "Heparin is a high-alert anticoagulant. Storing two different concentrations together creates a selection error risk that can result in 2-fold dosing errors.

The pharmacy director says 'the committee exists but we haven't had a formal meeting — we make decisions by email.' What does JC require?",
      baseOptions: [
        "JC does not specify meeting frequency for the P&T committee — decision-making by email is acceptable if decisions are documented",
        "JC requires the pharmacy and therapeutics function to occur through a defined, structured governance process that includes regular meetings with documented minutes showing formulary decisions, medication use policy reviews, medication safety event analysis, and high-alert medication oversight. An 8-month absence of formal meetings indicates the committee's governance function is not being fulfilled",
        "The requirement is met as long as all email decisions are archived — the medium of communication is not a JC compliance element",
        "P&T committee requirements apply only to hospitals with more than 200 beds — community hospitals may use informal decision-making processes"

      baseExplanation: "The pharmacy and therapeutics committee is a required governance structure for medication management oversight in JC-accredited facilities. Its functions — formulary management, medication use policy, high-alert medication oversight, and medication safety event review — require a structured process with documented evidence that the governance work is occurring. An 8-month gap in formal meetings represents an 8-month gap in structured governance of the medication management program.",

          options: [
            "Accept the efficiency argument and formalize a hybrid email-and-meeting model that JC would recognize",
            "The efficiency argument does not negate the governance requirement — P&T committee functions require interprofessional input (physician, pharmacy, nursing, quality) that email threads among pharmacy staff do not replace. The value of structured meetings is the deliberative process: varied perspectives, debate about safety evidence, and documented consensus from a defined group of stakeholders. The meeting format exists because it produces better, more accountable decisions than informal communication. 'Bureaucratic' efficiency concerns should be addressed by optimizing meeting design, not eliminating the governance function",
            "Implement quarterly P&T meetings and accept email for all routine interim decisions",

          correctIndex: 1,
          explanation: "Governance processes exist because they produce qualitatively different outcomes than informal decision-making — they require participation from multiple stakeholders, documentation of the reasoning behind decisions, and accountability to an institutional record. A P&T committee that functions primarily through pharmacy department emails excludes the physician, nursing, and quality perspectives that are central to medication safety governance. The solution to meeting inefficiency is better meeting design, not dissolution of the governance requirement.",

      baseQuestion: "A quality audit reveals that 28% of PRN pain medication administrations on a medical-surgical unit have no documented pain reassessment within the expected timeframe (30-60 minutes post-administration). The nursing manager says 'nurses reassess — they just don't always document it.' How should this finding be approached?",
      baseOptions: [
        "Accept the manager's explanation — nursing documentation practices do not always capture all clinical activities",
        "Investigate whether the gap is documentation-only or reflects actual missed reassessments — the distinction matters clinically. If reassessments are not occurring, patients may have undertreated pain or unrecognized adverse effects (respiratory depression, oversedation). If reassessments are occurring but not documented, the quality record is incomplete. Either finding requires corrective action: actual missed reassessments require workflow redesign; documentation gaps require a documentation improvement process and may also indicate the reassessment is not reliably occurring",

Pain reassessment after PRN opioid administration serves dual purposes: verifying analgesic effectiveness and detecting adverse effects (respiratory depression, oversedation). A 28% rate of undocumented reassessments requires investigation to determine the actual cause. Neither explanation — missed documentation or missed assessment — is acceptable at this rate without corrective action.",

            "Address the documentation gap only — the 71% actual assessment rate is clinically acceptable",
            "Two concurrent interventions: (1) redesign the workflow to make pain reassessment more reliable — perhaps through a prompt in the EHR or medication administration workflow that requires pain score entry before closing the PRN administration; (2) address the documentation gap separately through documentation training and feedback. The 29% missed assessment rate is not clinically acceptable for PRN opioids where adverse effects can progress rapidly",

Opioid-induced respiratory depression can develop within 30-60 minutes of administration. An EHR prompt that requires pain score entry as part of completing the PRN documentation converts the reassessment from an optional follow-up to a required step in the administration workflow — making the right action the default action.
