These selective standards assess compliance with state-specific requirements for outpatient surgery settings — primarily California Business and Professions Code and Health and Safety Code provisions for outpatient surgery, and New York Public Health Law provisions for office-based surgery centers. The standards verify that organizations accurately report their services, entity structure, personnel, and other profile information.",

      title: "VAL Overview — What the Validation Category Covers",
      content:
        "The VAL category is unique among AAAHC categories: it validates profile/application information rather than standards of care. Its purpose is to ensure that the information organizations provide to AAAHC in their application accurately reflects their actual operations. All VAL standards are selective (not universal) — they apply when the organization has self-identified certain characteristics in its profile. Most VAL standards are specific to state regulatory requirements: California outpatient surgery settings and New York office-based surgery centers. Standards verify that state-required reports were made, that the organization meets state definitions, and that profile information is accurate.",
      keyPoint:
        "VAL validates that your AAAHC application is accurate. If your services or structure changed, your application must be updated. VAL findings typically arise when the profile says one thing and practice reflects another.",

      title: "California VAL Standards — Outpatient Surgery Anesthesia Requirements",

        "California Business and Professions Code §2216 prohibits physicians from performing procedures in outpatient settings using anesthesia (beyond local/peripheral nerve block) in doses that have the probability of placing patients at risk for loss of protective reflexes — unless the setting meets specific requirements and is accredited. VAL.190 verifies that if the organization performs such procedures, this is accurately reflected in the AAAHC profile. VAL.200 verifies that the organization meets California HSC §1248's definition of an 'outpatient setting.'",
      keyPoint:
        "California VAL standards apply when anesthesia beyond local/peripheral nerve block creates loss-of-protective-reflex risk. If you perform procedures with moderate/deep sedation or general anesthesia in California, your profile must accurately reflect this.",

    {
      title: "California Adverse Event and Death Reporting Requirements",
      content:
        "For California outpatient surgery settings providing anesthesia at loss-of-protective-reflex levels, specific reporting requirements apply: VAL.430 — adverse events per HSC §1279.1 must be reported to the Medical Board of California within five days (or 24 hours for ongoing urgent threats) per BPC §2216.3. VAL.440 — deaths or transfers per BPC §2240 must be reported using required forms. VAL.450 — patient deaths require the Outpatient Surgery Patient Death Reporting Form submitted to the Medical Board within 15 days. VAL.460 — transfers exceeding 24 hours require Parts A&B filed in the patient's medical record and Part B submitted to OSHPD within 15 days.",

The VAL standards for New York verify that the AAAHC profile accurately reflects: the types of healthcare professionals employed (VAL.210); whether the practice has a separate billing entity (VAL.220); whether a billing and collection service is used for all accounts receivable (VAL.230); ownership and financial interest structure (VAL.240-250); physical address and state certification (VAL.260, VAL.280); procedural record maintenance (VAL.290); infection control plan and required incident reporting (VAL.300, VAL.310); and adherence to NYSDOH certificate of need requirements (VAL.320).",

When operational changes occur — new services, new locations, change in anesthesia level offered, change in billing structure, addition or departure of key personnel — the AAAHC profile must be updated promptly. Profile inaccuracies discovered during survey result in VAL findings — and may affect accreditation status if significant.",
