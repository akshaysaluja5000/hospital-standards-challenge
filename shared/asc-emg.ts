    plainLanguageSummary:
      "The EMG category requires ASCs to develop, maintain, and test a comprehensive emergency and disaster preparedness plan. The plan must address hazard identification, internal and external emergencies, continuity of operations, resource management, staff training, and coordination with community emergency response organizations. The plan must be exercised through drills and updated based on lessons learned.",
    keyOperationalExpectations: [
      "A written emergency and disaster preparedness plan is approved by the governing body.",
      "The plan is based on a hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) identifying likely emergency scenarios.",
      "All staff receive training on the emergency plan and their specific roles.",
      "Emergency drills are conducted at defined intervals with documented debriefs and improvement actions.",
      "The plan addresses both internal emergencies (fire, medical emergency, power failure) and external disasters (natural disasters, mass casualty events).",
      "Coordination with community emergency management organizations is documented.",

    commonRiskPoints: [
      "Emergency plan exists but has never been tested through drills — no documentation of any exercise.",

      title: "EMG.100 — The Written Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan",
      content:
        "The organization must have a written emergency and disaster preparedness plan approved by the governing body. The plan must be based on a hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) that identifies emergencies most likely to affect the organization — considering geographic location, facility type, patient population, and historical events. The plan must address: internal emergencies (fire, medical emergency, utility failure); external disasters (natural disasters, mass casualty events, community infrastructure failures); continuity of operations; communication protocols; resource management; evacuation procedures; and patient care during emergencies.",
      keyPoint:
        "The plan starts with an HVA — identifying likely risks drives the plan content. Without an HVA, the plan is generic rather than tailored to the organization's actual risk profile.",
    },
    {
      title: "EMG.110 — Staff Training on the Emergency Plan",
      content:
        "All personnel must receive training on the emergency and disaster preparedness plan appropriate to their role. Training must occur at orientation for new employees and at defined intervals (at minimum annually) thereafter. Staff must be able to demonstrate knowledge of: their specific emergency roles, how to initiate emergency responses (what to call, who to notify), locations of emergency equipment and supplies, evacuation routes and assembly points, and how to communicate during emergencies. Training records must be maintained.",
      keyPoint:
        "Training must produce demonstrated knowledge — not just attendance documentation. Surveyors interview staff: 'Where is the nearest fire extinguisher?' 'What is the emergency code for cardiac arrest?' Staff must answer correctly.",
    },
    {
      title: "EMG.120 — Emergency Drills: Frequency, Documentation, and Improvement",
      content:
        "Emergency drills must be conducted at defined intervals and must cover the types of emergencies identified in the HVA. At minimum, fire drills are typically required in each occupied facility on each shift annually (per NFPA 101). Drills must be followed by a debrief that identifies: what went well, what needs improvement, and specific action items with owners and completion timelines. The actions from drills must be implemented and tracked. Drill records must document: date, type of drill, participants, scenario, observations, debriefing findings, and corrective actions.",
      keyPoint:
        "Drills without debriefs are incomplete. The debrief and its resulting action items are the mechanism by which drills produce system improvement. Action items must be tracked to completion.",
    },
    {
      title: "EMG.130 — Resource Management During Emergencies",
      content:
        "The emergency plan must address resource management — ensuring the organization can identify, obtain, and manage resources needed during an emergency. This includes: identification of critical supply inventories and minimum stock levels; sources for emergency resupply; agreements with community organizations (mutual aid agreements); communication systems that function during power outages; and protocols for managing patients and personnel during extended emergencies. Plans for sheltering in place and patient evacuation must address patients who cannot be immediately transported.",
      keyPoint:
        "Resource management is the 'can we sustain operations?' component of emergency preparedness. Plans must address supplies, communications, personnel, and patient care continuity for a realistic sustained emergency scenario.",
    },
    {
      title: "EMG.140 — Community Coordination",
      content:
        "The emergency plan must address coordination with community emergency management organizations — including local emergency management agencies, hospitals, public health agencies, and other healthcare organizations. This may include participation in community emergency preparedness planning exercises, mutual aid agreements with other healthcare facilities, and protocols for communicating with emergency management during a disaster. The plan must reflect actual relationships — agreements that exist on paper but have never been tested or communicated are insufficient.",
      keyPoint:
