        "Leave the patients in their rooms with doors closed — the fire department will rescue them when they arrive",

JC requires that evacuation plans specifically address non-ambulatory patients, identify areas of refuge, include procedures for staff-to-fire-department communication, and be tested during drills that include non-ambulatory patient scenarios. The plan must be revised and the revision tested in the next scheduled drill",
            "The fire department delay is the primary contributing factor — the planning gap is secondary and requires only documentation of the delay",

      baseQuestion: "During a life safety tracer, a surveyor examines the fire door at the entrance to the ICU. The door has a self-closing mechanism, latches when released, and appears fully operational. However, the surveyor notices that the door frame has visible light infiltration around three sides when the door is closed. What is the significance of this finding?",
      baseOptions: [
        "No significance — light infiltration around a closed door is a cosmetic finding without life safety implications",
        "Visible light around a closed fire door indicates gaps in the door-frame assembly that compromise the fire rating — smoke and hot gases can pass through gaps that are large enough to transmit light. The gaps may result from warped frames, missing intumescent seals, or damaged door hardware. A fire door that allows light infiltration may not provide the rated protection during a fire event",
        "Significance only if the light infiltration exceeds 1/4 inch in width — small gaps are within tolerance for fire door assemblies",
        "The finding is limited to energy efficiency — light around doors indicates air infiltration that affects HVAC performance but not fire door function"
      ],
      baseCorrectIndex: 1,
      baseExplanation: "Light infiltration around a closed fire door is a recognized indicator of gap integrity failure. NFPA 80 specifies clearance requirements for fire doors (typically 1/8 inch on sides and top, 3/4 inch at the bottom for unsealed doors) — gaps that allow visible light may exceed these tolerances. Intumescent seals that are missing, deteriorated, or compressed will not expand in heat to close the gaps during a fire. This requires repair by a qualified fire door inspector.",

          question: "The facilities team schedules the door frame repair for the next maintenance cycle 'in about 6 weeks.' Is this timeframe compliant for a compromised ICU fire door?",
          options: [
            "Yes — 6 weeks is within the standard maintenance scheduling timeframe for non-emergency findings",
            "No — a compromised fire door in an ICU fire compartment boundary requires prompt repair, not standard queue scheduling. The ICU contains non-ambulatory patients who depend entirely on fire compartmentalization for survival. A gap-compromised fire door between the ICU and adjacent areas means the compartment boundary is not functioning as rated. This should trigger ILSM documentation for the affected compartment and an accelerated repair timeline — typically days, not weeks, for patient care area fire door failures",
            "Compliant if the ICU has redundant fire doors in the same compartment boundary — backup fire doors reduce urgency",
            "Yes if the door's self-closing mechanism is functioning — the self-closing function is the primary fire door performance criterion; gap sealing is secondary"
          ],
          correctIndex: 1,
          explanation: "Repair timeline urgency for life safety findings must be proportional to the risk created by the deficiency. A gap-compromised fire door in an ICU — where patients are fully dependent on compartmentalization for evacuation protection — is not a standard maintenance queue item. ILSM documentation for the affected compartment and an accelerated repair timeline reflect the urgency appropriate to the risk. A 6-week repair timeline treats a patient safety issue as a routine maintenance item.",

      baseQuestion: "A hospital's life safety officer documents a hazardous materials storage room that has flammable liquids (isopropyl alcohol, acetone) stored on metal shelving without secondary containment, adjacent to an electrical panel with a 12-inch clearance. The OSHA standard requires 36-inch clearance around electrical panels. What life safety violations are present?",
      baseOptions: [
        "One finding — the OSHA 36-inch electrical panel clearance is the primary violation; the liquid storage is acceptable in a designated hazardous materials room",
        "Multiple findings: (1) flammable liquids stored without secondary containment in a metal-shelf room create a spill fire risk — NFPA 30 requires secondary containment to prevent spilled flammables from spreading; (2) the 12-inch clearance from flammable liquids to an electrical panel is a combustion hazard — an arc or spark from the panel could ignite flammable vapors; (3) OSHA 29 CFR 1910.303 requires 36 inches of clear working space in front of electrical panels; the combination of violations creates an intersecting fire and explosion risk",
        "The finding is limited to the electrical panel clearance — hazardous materials storage is subject to EPA regulations, not OSHA or NFPA during facility inspections",
        "A single combined finding — OSHA electrical clearance requirements subsume the NFPA flammable storage concerns"
      ],
      baseCorrectIndex: 1,
      baseExplanation: "The co-location of flammable liquids without secondary containment adjacent to an electrical panel with insufficient clearance creates an additive life safety risk. A spill from the shelving without secondary containment allows flammable liquid to reach the panel area. An arc at the panel ignites the flammable vapor from the spill or from the liquid's evaporation. Each violation is independently citable; their combination creates a potentially catastrophic incident scenario.",

          question: "The safety officer proposes addressing both findings by relocating the electrical panel rather than the flammable storage — the panel is fixed infrastructure but the storage can be moved. The facilities team argues that panel relocation is costly and difficult. Who is correct, and what is the optimal solution?",
          options: [
            "The safety officer — the electrical panel should be relocated to resolve both findings simultaneously",
            "The facilities team is correct that flammable storage relocation is the easier solution. The optimal response is to: (1) immediately remove the flammable liquids from the current room; (2) identify a compliant NFPA 30 flammable storage room or cabinet; (3) install secondary containment in the compliant storage location; (4) restore the 36-inch electrical panel clearance by removing all storage from the panel proximity. This resolves both violations without major infrastructure work. Panel relocation should be evaluated only if no compliant alternative storage exists",
            "The facilities team is correct — electrical panel relocation is the definitive solution, and a 3-year capital plan timeline is acceptable for infrastructure projects",
            "Neither — both findings must be reported to OSHA and AHJ simultaneously before any corrective action may be taken"
          ],
          correctIndex: 1,
          explanation: "The most efficient resolution addresses the modifiable element — storage can be moved more easily than fixed electrical infrastructure. Removing the flammable liquids from the room eliminates both the NFPA 30 containment violation and the fire proximity hazard near the panel, while also restoring the required electrical panel clearance. This is a rapid, low-cost solution that does not require capital investment. The principle is to match the corrective action to the easiest compliant solution, not the most complex one.",
